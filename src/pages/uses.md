# Use

Tools that I use to make my life easier as a developer. I try a lot of things and I change from one tool to another. I hope this list covers everything:

## Hardware

- Mackbook Pro (2018) hexacore i7, 32GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Radeon Pro 560X 4GB RAM üò±Ô∏è. This beast is my work computer.
- Lenovo Ideapad Y500 (2013) running Linux Mint 19.1, I have added a 512GB SSD and 16GB RAM (would have liked 32, but the motherboard supports only 16). This is my personal computer and despite its age with the upgrades that I have made still handles stuff pretty well.
- Logitech MX Masters 2 is my favorite mouse ever. Even though I cannot configure it as much as I would like in Linux Mint, it still is a top notch mouse and the fact that I can use it on any surface and connect to multiple computers makes it the perfect mouse for me.
- Bose Quiet Comfort 35 II saved me in very noisy environments like my current workplace. This headset has amazing sound quality and it is so easy to connect them to multiple devices.

## Editor & terminal

- Visual Studio Code - I have used NetBeans, Sublime Text, Atom in the past, but for the past 3 years I have been using VSCode as my one and only editor.
- One Dark Pro Theme - loved Atom's One Dark theme, this is my main theme for VSCode, I seldomly try or use any other themes.
- Hyper - why not a JS terminal with material theme??
- zsh & oh-my-zsh - extremely productive shell using amuse theme and a bunch of plugins

## Desktop apps

- Google Chrome - main developer browser. Sorry Firefox, Chrome still has better devtools üò™Ô∏è.
- Firefox - used for browsing.
- Spotify - music is key for my peace of mind during coding.

## Recording

- OBS - I use to record and stream videos
- Plantronics Blackwire C310 - I use it for the microphone which is decent compared to the price of the headset.
